## Introduction to Application Development Specialization
### About this Specialization

This Specialization is intended for anyone seeking to become an application programmer with no existing experience. Through four courses, you'll learn about the fundamental concepts of programming, object-orientation, and several necessary tools including source control and build automation. You'll also review several popular development methodologies that will likely be used in any programming career.
### Applied Learning Project

This specialization is largely conceptual, so it isn't as hands-on as learning a programming language, but it does include some hands-on labs to practice your new foundational programming skills. You'll be able to utilize the Coursera lab environment to practice and to get a feel for how a programming environment is structured, and how you will set up and customize your environment to work best for you. This specialization will prepare you to dive into the Java development language and begin your programming career.
